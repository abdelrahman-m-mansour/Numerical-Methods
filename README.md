MATLAB implementations of Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi, SOR/SUR, and Bisection methods
# Numerical Methods – MATLAB Implementation

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of several numerical methods
used to solve systems of linear equations and nonlinear equations.

## Implemented Methods

1. **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**
   - Partial pivoting
   - Converts augmented matrix to identity matrix

2. **Jacobi Iterative Method**
   - Includes diagonal dominance checking
   - Calculates significant digits

3. **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and Under-Relaxation (SUR)**
   - User-defined relaxation factor α
   - Convergence analysis with significant digits

4. **Bisection Method**
   - Root finding for nonlinear equations
   - Iterative table output with tolerance

## Files

- `GaussJordan.m`
- `JacobiMethod.m`
- `SorSur.m`
- `Bracketing.m`


## Usage
Run each `.m` file separately in MATLAB.
